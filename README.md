# App Scheduler

## Architecture and Libraries
1. Kotlin
2. MVVM
3. Dagger-hilt
4. Room
5. WorkManager
6. Lottie


## Notes
1. From Android 10 and higher (Display over other permission) is required to do the background work. Below Android 10 App is working absolutely fine.
2. Background Intent(App Launcher) is not working on MIUI(Android 10 or higher) because of MIUI optimisation. But below Android 10 it is ok.
3. AppScheduler is working on every version when app is on Foreground.
